# Sol - The World's First Interplanetary Weather App

Sol is a mobile application (iPhone only at the moment) that allows the end user to view their local weather information and then compare it to that of Mars. The Mars weather information is thanks to the wealth of data supplied by the [Curiosity Rover on Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_%28rover%29).

Sol uses these 3rd-party resources:

* [{MAAS} API](https://github.com/ingenology/mars_weather_api) - Mars weather information
* [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/) - Earth/local weather information
* [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) - Geo-coding user zip codes
* Facebook
* Twitter

This was built on the XML-based Rarewire mobile application publishing platform. Additional information regarding this platform can be [found here](http://rarewire.com/).
